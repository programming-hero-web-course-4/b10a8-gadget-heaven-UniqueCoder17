### React Fundamentals Used

This project incorporates several essential React concepts, including:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** Structuring the UI into reusable components like `Gadgets`, `NavBar`, `Profile`, and `Dashboard`.

2. **State Management with Hooks:** Using `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects, such as loading and filtering gadgets.

3. **React Router:** Enabling smooth page navigation with components like `NavLink`, `useLocation`, and `Outlet` for a single-page app experience.

4. **Conditional Rendering:** Conditionally displaying components and styles based on state or route paths.

5. **Props Passing:** Passing data through props to enable child components, like the `Gadget` component, to display specific gadget data.

### Data Management

Data in this project is handled through:

- **Local Storage:** Used for persistent storage of cart and wishlist items, allowing data to be saved across sessions.

3. **Profile Creation:** Users can create and manage their profiles, adding personal information like name, email, and phone number.
